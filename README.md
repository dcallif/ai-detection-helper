## How It Works

The AI Detection Helper analyzes text using multiple indicators:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes repetitive structures and formulaic writing patterns
- **Descriptive Density**: Measures the concentration of descriptive elements
- **Structural Consistency**: Evaluates writing structure uniformity
- **Natural Variation**: Measures organic variability in expression
- **Scene Construction**: Analyzes methodical scene building

Each indicator contributes to an overall AI probability score, providing a comprehensive analysis of the content's likely origin.
